# **Spine Health AI**

## **Overview**
**Spine Health AI** provides **AI-powered tools** for analyzing spinal health using advanced **medical imaging techniques** like **CT scans** and **MRI**. The project leverages **deep learning**, **machine learning**, and **computer vision** methods to assist healthcare professionals in **early diagnosis** and developing more **effective treatment plans** for spinal conditions.

This repository includes **pretrained models**, **preprocessing utilities**, and **evaluation tools** for key tasks such as **automated fracture detection**, **osteoporosis risk prediction**, **spine segmentation**, and more. The tools aim to improve clinical workflows, speed up diagnoses, and support medical practitioners in decision-making.

By utilizing **advanced data augmentation**, **cross-validation**, and **model persistence** techniques, the models are designed to be **robust**, **scalable**, and adaptable to different datasets and clinical environments.
